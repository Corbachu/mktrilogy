Ed,

This build contains all of the fixes from you last memo
except for the Aggressor Shadow Effect.  I am working on
that today.  Please take a look at the brutality move for 
kung lao as well as the brutality work effect.  Also the duck kicks
as well as the combos should be fixed.  I believe I found the problems 
and have corrected them.  Also, any progress on locating the axe frames for
nightwolf?

David
