License to another party, provided the other party reads and agrees to accept 
the terms and conditions of this License.

nor any other technical data received from Williams, nor the direct product 
thereof (whether a process or service or otherwise), will be directly or indirectly 
exported or transmitted outside the United States except as authorized and as 
permitted by the laws and regulations of the United States, and in particular 
where such export or transmission is restricted by any applicable U.S. regulation 
or statute, you will not do so without the prior, written consent, if required, of the 
Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, or such 
other governmental entity as may have jurisdiction over such export or 
transmission.  If the Software has been rightfully obtained by you outside of the 
United States, you agree that you will not re-export or transmit, directly or 
indirectly, the Software nor any other technical data received from Williams, nor

where such re-export or transmission is restricted by any applicable U.S. 
regulation or statute, you will not do so without the prior, written consent, if 
required, of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of

export or transmission) and the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which 
you obtained the Software.

5.	Government End Users.  If you are acquiring the Software on behalf of 
any unit or agency of the United States Government, the following provisions 
apply.  The Government agrees:
(i) if the Software is supplied to the Department of Defense (DoD), the 
Software is classified as "Commercial Computer Software" and the Government 
is acquiring only "restricted rights" in the Software and its documentation as that 
term is defined in Clause 252.227-7013(c)(1) of the DFARS; and
(ii) if the Software is supplied to any unit or agency of the United States 
Government other than DoD, the Government’s rights in the Software and its 
documentation will be as defined in Clause 52.277-19(c)(2) of the FAR or, in the 
case of NASA, in Clause 18-52.227-896(d) of the NASA Supplement to the FAR.

6.	Disclaimer Of Warranty on Software.  You expressly acknowledge and 
agree that use of the Software and the media on which it is recorded is at your

IS" and without warranty of any kind and Williams and Williams’ licensor(s) (for 
the purposes of provisions 6 and 7, Williams and Williams’ licensor(s) shall be

OR MEDIA PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (AND NOT WILLIAMS OR A WILLIAMS 
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THE FEES FOR THE

ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

7.	Limitation of Liability.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE, SHALL WILLIAMS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION, 
EVEN IF WILLIAMS OR A WILLIAMS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE HAS 
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  SOME 
JURISDICITONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF 
LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE 
ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  In no event 
shall Williams’ total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action 
(whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) exceed the amount 
paid by you for the Software.

8.	Controlling Law and Severability.  This License shall be governed by 
and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of 
Illinois, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely 
within Illinois between Illinois residents.  If for any reason a court of competent 
jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or a portion thereof, to be 
unenforceable, that provision of the License shall be enforced to the maximum 
extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of 
this License shall continue in full force and effect.

9.	Complete Agreement.  This License constitutes the entire agreement 
between the parties with respect to the use of the Software and the related 
documentation, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings or 
agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter.  No amendment to or 
modification of this License will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly 
authorized representative of Williams.
