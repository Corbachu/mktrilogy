Story Intro #1 

Thousands of years ago an order of the wisest men from the far east received visions of the dark realm known as the OUTWORLD. It was a world ruled by chaos and a vicious  emperor known as SHAO KAHN.

They learned that travel between Earth and the new found realm would someday be possible if the conditions were right. the conditions being the unbalancing of the furies- negative and positive forces which keep our unstable universe from collapsing onto itself.

Knowing that an Outworld invasion was eminent, the wise men appealed to the Elder Gods. It was for this reason the Elder Gods created the tournament called MORTAL KOMBAT.


Story Intro #2

For nine generations Mortal Kombat was ruled by Outworld's finest warrior- Prince Goro. The Earth was on the brink of it's destruction when a new generation of warriors were victorious in defending its realm.

The warrior monk, Liu Kang, would become the new champion. But his victory was short lived as he and his comrades find themselves lured into the Outworld to compete in a second tournament.

Little did they know that the tournament was merely a diversion. A scheme devised by the dark emperor to break the rules set forth by the Elder Gods and witness the reincarnation of his former queen Sindel on the Earth realm itself. This unholy act gives Shao Kahn the power to step through the dimensional gates and reclaim his queen, thus enabling him to finally seize the Earth.

These are the trilogy of events which comprise Shao Kahn's final attempt at taking the Earth.

Rain:  Born in Kitana's former world of Edenia, Rain was smuggled away from the realm as a small child shortly after Shao Kahn's take over.

New Character Endings

Rain:   Rain fights valiantly for the emperor Shao Kahn. But it would be Kahn's own step daughter, the Princess Kitana who turns Rain against him. Like Kitana, Rain's origins also come from their former realm of Edenia. He learns that his father was once a general in Edenia's army and died at the hands of Shao Kahn himself.
   Enraged at the truth about his history, he joins Kitana in aligning with the Earth realm warriors.

To prove his loyalty he embarked on a suicide mission to destroy Shao Kahn and end the menace once and for all.  

Noob Saibot:    At first a passive observer, Noob Saibot would soon receive orders to side with the evil emperor Shao Kahn. Saibot's leaders in the Netherealm want him to join Kahn's battle to gain his trust and to gain entrance into the Earth realm. 
   When Kahn drops his guard, Noob Saibot is ordered to attack. With both the Earth realm and the Outworld's emperor defeated, The fallen Elder God known as Shinnok can take both realms and gain the power he needs to strike back at the Elder God's who banished him into the Netherealm.

Ermac:    When Kahn finally eliminates his opposition, he finds a new and surprising foe in Ermac.  The Outworld souls that give life to the warrior did not trust their tyrannical leader who planned to consume the powerful life force for his own power.
   Even Shao Kahn's power was no match for the overwhelming strength of legions of deceased Outworld warriors. They destroyed their master in battle that devastated the entire realm. Ermac was left behind to rule it with his own brand of oppression.

Baraka:   When Baraka's failure to apprehend several Earth warriors nearly results in  Shao Kahn's demise, the nomad finds himself fearing for his own life. He falls out of favor with his emperor, and realizes that it's only a matter of time before Kahn enacts revenge.
   Baraka remains loyal until the opposition from the Earth realm has been defeated. With Kahn in a weakened state from his battle with Rayden, Baraka strikes. The despondent emperor is no match for Baraka's  attack. Then, fearing reprisal from those loyal to Kahn, Baraka escapes back into nomadic ruins from which he came. 

Johnny Cage:  With his nearly deceased soul restored, Johnny Cage finds himself fighting along side his friends once again. This time he seeks revenge against the extermination squad that took his life. But during their battle, Cage learns that if they when against Kahn, his soul will again be deceased when Earth reverts back to normal.

The Earth warriors emerge victorious and when the realms revert to their normal state, Cage bids farewell to his comrades as his soul leaves to higher place.

Smoke (human):    Before his transformation into a cybernetic assassin, Smoke was one of the Lin Kuei's finest ninja. It was during this time that he came to know his greatest ally- Sub-Zero. When the Lin Kuei decide to automate their warriors, the two attempt to escape.
    While Sub-Zero successfully eluded capture, Smoke did not. He would become a robotic nightmare, his soul trapped inside a living machine. In his human form Smoke was a fierce warrior, in his mechanical body he is even more lethal. But, his true form is that of a human, one he'll know again only in dreams.

Mileena:  When Mileena is murdered, she finds her soul reborn in an evil place called the Netherealm. Here she accepts servitude to an all mighty god known as Shinnok. It is Shinnok who allows her soul to be reborn on the Outworld. Her loyalty to Shao Kahn is replaced by her fear of Shinnok.
   Mileena plots to overthrow her own father.  The ability to read Kitana's mind and predict the Earth warriors' motives, enables Mileena to set up her fathers downfall. When Kahn is weakened by the onslaught of attacks, Mileena takes the opportunity to destroy her father and allow Shinnok to step forward and take both realms for his own sinister purposes.
